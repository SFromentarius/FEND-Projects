# Memory Game Project
## Goal
You need to find all 8 pairs of card, with the same sign.
## How to play
Click on one card at a time and try to find the pairs.
- There is a timer, counting your time. Try to finish the game as fast as possible!
- At the beginning, you have 3 stars. After 20 moves, you have 2 stars. And after 35 moves you have only 1 star.
- You can also restart the game by clicking on the "restart" button.

At the end of the game, a modal appears and inform you about your time, star rate and how many moves you did to finish the game.
Enjoy!

## Starter instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. We needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
