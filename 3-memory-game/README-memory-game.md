The Memory Game Project is the third project from the FEND of Udacity.

# Memory Game Project

To start, click on a card. Then, you must find the pair of this card: the one that has the same sign.
To finish the game, you must find the 8 pairs of similar cards.
A timer is triggered at the beginning of the game, and your game is rated according to a star system.
You can also start the game from the beginning by clicking on the "restart" button.

## Instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. We needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
